(* Clash of identifiers between dec_2 (argument of expand IND_CPA_sym_enc)
   and the renaming of dec (variable in the main process).

   This is because record_id records identifiers defined in the definition
   of the macro, not in its expansion. So it records dec, not dec_2,
   which allows variables to be later renamed into dec_2. *)
