(* In CV 2.00, this example causes an internal error:
   the transformation of f(x[i]) into new y: bool; g(y,x)
   creates a restriction which should be inside the condition
   of find and this is impossible.
   This bug manifests as follows: the variable y is created
   with args_at_creation as if it were inside the condition
   of find, but the new is put outside the condition of 
   find, leading to
Internal error: Bad args_at_creation for y
Please report bug to Bruno.Blanchet@inria.fr, including input file and output

   Fixed by forbidding the transformation in this case.
