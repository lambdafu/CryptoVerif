(* There was a bug until CV 2.01pl1: 
   It claimed that the probability of success of the assignment
   let concat(a1,=a2) = b in 
   is 1/|nonce|. It is in fact |t1|/|nonce|, which is larger:
   it succeeds for any value of a1. *)


type t1.
type t2 [fixed,large].
type nonce [fixed,large].

fun concat(t1,t2):nonce [data].

channel c,d.

event e1.

query event(e1).

process
	in(c, (a2:t2));
	new b: nonce;
	let concat(a1,=a2) = b in
