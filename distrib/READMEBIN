This package contains executables for Windows, documentation, and
examples of a cryptographic protocol verifier. The source code is
available as separate package. The material contained in this package
is under the CeCILL-B license. (The CeCILL-B license is a BSD-style
license. See the file LICENSE for more information.)

This software can be used to prove secrecy and authentication
properties of cryptographic protocols, in the computational model. (If
you want a verifier for the Dolev-Yao model, please download
ProVerif.)

INSTALL under Windows NT, 2000, or XP

Uncompress the archive cryptoverifbinVERSION.zip, in
the directory of your choice. This will create a subdirectory named
cryptoverifVERSION.

The system can run under Windows, but it is not very Windows-friendly:
you have to use the command line to run the programs. Improving the interface
is on the to-do list...

In order to run implementations of protocols generated by 
CryptoVerif, you need to have the Caml cryptographic library
"cryptokit" installed. This library is available at
  http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/cryptokit/
You need to either 
- arrange so that the installed cryptokit library is in
subdirectory "implementation/cryptokit" of the CryptoVerif
distribution
- or install the cryptokit library in the "cryptokit" subdirectory
of the Caml standard library
- or modify the variable CRYPTOKIT in the scripts
implementation/npsk/build.sh
implementation/wlsk/build_wlsk.sh
implementation/ssh/build.sh
so that the cryptokit library is included.

USAGE

This software contains one executable program, cryptoverif.  It takes as
input a description of a cryptographic protocol, and checks whether it
can leak some secrets. The subdirectory examples contains examples
of cryptographic protocols. To run CryptoVerif on example X, execute
	./cryptoverif examples/X
e.g.	./cryptoverif examples/otway-rees3Stream

Note: CryptoVerif must be run in the directory that contains the files
"default.cvl" and "default.ocvl" (which is the cryptoverifVERSION
directory). CryptoVerif accesses these files which contain definitions
of cryptographic primitives.

I warmly thank David Pointcheval for his advice and explanations
of the computational proofs of protocols. This project would not have
been possible without him.
