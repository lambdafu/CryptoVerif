In order to prove the correspondence finish(y) ==> start(y),
it sees that when finish(y) is executed, we have
y = g(x'), x = g(x') and start(x). In order to prove start(y)
knowing start(x), it assumes x <> y and tries to prove a contradiction
from: y = g(x'), x = g(x'), x <> y.
Then the problem appears: substituting x with y their values,
it should obviously obtain g(x') <> g(x') which yields a contradiction.
However, while it correctly orients the equality y = g(x') into
y -> g(x'), it fails to orient x = g(x') because of a heuristic that
prevents creating x -> ... when x is created by a "new".
So x is not replaced with g(x') and the proof fails.
The obvious solution would be to disable this heuristic; however,
this heuristic is very useful in many other examples...
