(* The variable f is renamed into f_1 and f_2, leading to a confusion
   with the function f_1, which is not renamed. 
   Internally, CryptoVerif correctly distinguishes them, but
   the display is very confusing:

     let f_2: bitstring = f_1 in
     out(c, f_1(f_2))

     in(c, f_1: bitstring);
     out(c, f_1(f_1))

	in(c, f_3: bitstring);
let f_4: bitstring = f_3 in
out(c, f_1(f_4))
