(* The "let y" inside the condition of find should not be expanded,
because we must make sure that x is defined before being able to
execute the "let".
This file causes an internal error at invariant checking after 
the expansion of if/let/find/new.

Fix 23/11/2009 This file is rejected: if/let/find/new are not accepted inside
conditions of find.
That's ok. I could be more permissive and accept this file.

Fix 23/11/2009, file accepted, but there is still a bug in expansion 
of terms/processes

Fix 23/11/2009 expansion bug fixed, but now I get an internal error
in simplification!

Fix 23/11/2009 simplification bug fixed. I get the same bug as in 
bug_transform_findcond.cv
