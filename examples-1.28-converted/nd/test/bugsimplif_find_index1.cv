(*
The simplification of 
find j' <= N suchthat defined(k[j']) && j = j'
should yield
if defined(k[j]) ...
since the condition implies that j' = j.
However, this works only when the condition is oriented j' = ,
not in the other direction. 
(With the condition j' = j, we rewrite j' into j, so we get the value of j'. 
 With the condition j = j', we rewrite j into j', so the value of j' is unchanged
 and CryptoVerif does not manage to do the simplification...)
