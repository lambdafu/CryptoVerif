(* This file should be rejected. We cannot expand the "let y" inside the
condition of "find" because we must make sure that x is defined before
executing the "let. Furthermore, we make an array reference on y, which is
defined in the condition of find.

Fix 23/11/2009 This file is rejected: if/let/find/new are not accepted inside
conditions of find.
That's ok. I could be more permissive, but this file must be rejected
because it makes a find on the variable y defined in a condition of find.

Fix 23/11/2009 File correctly rejected because it makes a find on the 
variable y defined in a condition of find.
