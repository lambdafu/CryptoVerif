(* CryptoVerif makes a wrong computation of probabilities.
To count the number of calls to the encryption oracle,
it computes a "max" between the two branches of find,
but this is correct only when the current replication index
appears as a factor. Here, the encryption oracle
is called N2 times in each branch of find.
In total, it is called 2 N2 times.
