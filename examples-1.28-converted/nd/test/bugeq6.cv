(* CryptoVerif assumes that all restrictions used in an equivalence
are defined at all expressions that occur in the equivalence. This is not
true when some expressions do not use all restrictions. For instance,
here x in the equivalence does not use r. As a result, r need not be
defined at x. This is the case in processC above; r is not always defined when
x is output. 

Solutions: 
1) check that r is defined at every occurrence of () -> x, before
performing the transformation.
2) reorganize the restrictions when I perform the game transformation.

(2) is better (the transformation can be performed more often) but seems harder to do
(in the example given in this file, there is no place to put the generation of r,
but there are examples (see bugeq5.cv) in which it would be possible to move the
generation of r.)

If the input processes were restricted to be of the form
(!N in(c, ...)) | (!N in(c,...)) | ...)
i.e. possibly replicated inputs, but no replication just above a parallel
composition, then it should be possible to generate r just after the 
first input that follows the replication (provided the terms in the
channel and pattern matching in that input do not require r, but can they?).
