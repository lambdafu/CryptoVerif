(* 
I think there is a bug in the computation of probabilities:
pw = y is replaced with false with probability N*N/|passwd|
while I compare N pw with N*N2 y -> should be N*N*N2/|passwd|
Choosing random numbers in conditions of find is a bit strange
anyway, should I forbid that?
FIXED by forbidding new in find conditions
20/1/2021: now, new is allowed in find conditions. 
The probability is computed correctly.
