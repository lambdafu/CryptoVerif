(* 1. Compute and use simp_facts: facts that are separated into
   equalities that can be used as substitutions, other terms,
   else-find facts *)

(* Filter out terms if/let/find/res/event, so that the remaining terms
   can be used as facts *)
val filter_ifletfindres : term list -> term list

(* match_term is an intermediate function used for apply_reds. It is exported
   because we need to compute a variant of apply_reds in dependency analyses. *)
val match_term : simp_facts -> binder list -> (unit -> 'a) -> term -> term -> unit -> 'a

(* set to true by the functions below when they reduce the term *)
val reduced : bool ref

(* [apply_eq_statements_and_collisions_subterms_once reduce_rec try_no_var t] 
   simplifies the term [t] using the equalities coming from the
   equational theories, the equality statements, and the collisions  
   given in the input file.
   [reduce_rec f t] must simplify the term [t] knowing the fact [f] 
   in addition to the already known facts. It sets the flag [reduced]
   when [t] has really been modified.
   [try_no_var t] must simplify the term [t] by replacing variables
   with their values according to currently known facts. *)
val apply_eq_statements_and_collisions_subterms_once : (term -> term -> term) -> simp_facts -> term -> term

(* [apply_eq_statements_subterms_once try_no_var t] simplifies
   the term [t] using the equalities coming from the
   equational theories and the equality statements given in the input file.
   [try_no_var] is as above. *)
val apply_eq_statements_subterms_once : simp_facts -> term -> term

(* [apply_reds simp_facts t] applies all equalities coming from the
   equational theories, equality statements, and collisions given in
   the input file to all subterms of the term [t], taking into account
   the equalities in [simp_facts] to enable their application.
   Application is repeated until a fixpoint is reached. *)
val apply_reds : simp_facts -> term -> term

(* Display the facts. Mainly used for debugging *)
val display_elsefind : elsefind_fact -> unit
val display_facts : simp_facts -> unit

(* A dependency analysis is a function of type 
   [dep_anal = simp_facts -> term -> term -> term option] 
   such that [dep_anal facts t1 t2] is [Some t'] when [t1 = t2] 
   can be simplified into the term [t']
   up to negligible probability, by eliminating collisions
   between [t1] and [t2] using the results of some dependency analysis.
   Otherwise, [dep_anal facts t1 t2] returns [None].

   [no_dependency_anal] is a particular dependency analysis that
   does nothing, i.e. always returns [None].
   Other dependency analyses are defined in simplify.ml.
 *)
val no_dependency_anal : dep_anal

(* [simplif_add dep_anal facts t] updates the facts by taking into
   account that the term [t] is true. It can use [dep_anal] to eliminate
   collisions. 
   Raises Contradiction when the added fact [t] cannot be true when
   [facts] hold.
*)
val simplif_add : dep_anal -> simp_facts -> term -> simp_facts
(* [simplif_add_find_cond] is the same as [simplif_add] except
   that it allows (and ignores) terms that are not variables or function
   applications *)
val simplif_add_find_cond : dep_anal -> simp_facts -> term -> simp_facts
(* [simplif_add_list dep_anal facts tl] updates the facts by taking into
   account that the terms in [tl] are true. It can use [dep_anal] to eliminate
   collisions.
   Raises Contradiction when the added facts [tl] cannot be true when
   [facts] hold.
 *)

(* 2. Compute the facts that hold and the variables that are defined
   at certain program points. *)

(* [get_initial_history pp] gets the known_history corresponding to the program
   point [pp] *)
val get_initial_history : program_point -> known_history option

(* [def_vars_from_defined current_node def_list] returns the variables that
   are known to be defined when the condition of a find with defined condition 
   [def_list] holds. [current_node] is the node of the find, at which [def_list]
   is tested (may be returned by [get_node]).
   Raises Contradiction when a variable that must be defined when [def_list]
   is defined has no definition in the game. *)
val def_vars_from_defined : known_history option -> binderref list -> binderref list

(* [facts_from_defined current_node def_list] returns the facts that
   are known to hold when the condition of a find with defined condition

   Raises Contradiction when a variable that must be defined when [def_list]
   is defined has no definition in the game. *)
val facts_from_defined : known_history option -> binderref list -> term list

(* [get_def_vars_at pp] returns the variables that are known
   to be defined at program point [pp].
   May raise Contradiction when the program point [pp] is
   unreachable. *)
val get_def_vars_at : program_point -> binderref list

(* [get_facts_at pp] returns the facts that are known to hold
   at program point [pp].
   May raise Contradiction when the program point [pp] is
   unreachable. *)

(* [get_def_vars_full_block pp] returns the variables that are known
   to be defined at the end of the input...output block containing 
   program point [pp].
   May raise Contradiction when the program point [pp] is
   unreachable. *)
val get_def_vars_full_block : program_point -> binderref list

(* [get_facts_full_block pp] returns the facts that are known to hold
   at the end of the input...output block containing program point [pp].
   May raise Contradiction when the program point [pp] is
   unreachable. *)
val get_facts_full_block : program_point -> term list

(* [get_facts_full_block_cases pp] returns the facts that are known to hold
   at the end of the input...output block containing program point [pp]. 
   It is a modified version of
   [get_facts_full_block] to distinguish cases depending on the
   definition point of variables (instead of taking intersections), to
   facilitate the proof of correspondences.
   May raise Contradiction when the program point [pp] is
   unreachable. *)
val get_facts_full_block_cases : program_point -> term list * term list list list
 
(* [get_elsefind_facts_at pp] returns the elsefind facts that are known to hold

(* [filter_def_list accu l] returns a def_list that contains
   all elements of [accu] and [l] except the elements whose definition
   is implied by the definition of some other element of [l].
   The typical call is [filter_def_list [] l], which returns 
   a def_list that contains all elements of [l] except 
   the elements whose definition is implied by the definition 
   of some other element.*)
val filter_def_list : binderref list -> binderref list -> binderref list

(* [remove_subterms accu l] returns a def_list that contains
   all elements of [accu] and [l] except elements that
   also occur as subterms in [l].
   The typical call is  [remove_subterms [] l], which returns
   [l] with elements that occur as subterms removed. *)
val remove_subterms : binderref list -> binderref list -> binderref list

(* [eq_deflists dl dl'] returns true when the two def_list [dl]
   and [dl'] are equal (by checking mutual inclusion) *)
val eq_deflists : binderref list -> binderref list -> bool

(* [update_def_list_term already_defined newly_defined bl def_list tc' p'] 
   returns an updated find branch [(bl, def_list', tc'', p'')].
   This function should be called after modifying a branch of find 
   (when the find is a term), to make sure that all needed variables are defined.
   It updates in particular [def_list], but may also add defined conditions
   inside [tc'] or [p'].
   [already_defined] is a list of variables already known to be defined
   above the find.
   [newly_defined] is the set of variables whose definition is guaranteed
   by the old defined condition [def_list]; it is used only for a sanity check.
   [bl, def_list, tc', p'] describe the modified branch of find:
   [bl] contains the indices of find
   [def_list] is the old def_list
   [tc'] is the modified condition of the find
   [p'] is the modified then branch of the find. *)

    term findbranch

(* [update_def_list_process already_defined newly_defined bl def_list t' p1'] 
   returns an updated find branch [(bl, def_list', t'', p1'')].
   This function should be called after modifying a branch of find 
   (when the find is a process), to make sure that all needed variables are defined.
   It updates in particular [def_list], but may also add defined conditions
   inside [t'] or [p1'].
   [already_defined] is a list of variables already known to be defined
   above the find.
   [newly_defined] is the set of variables whose definition is guaranteed
   by the old defined condition [def_list]; it is used only for a sanity check.

   about them *)

(* [simplify_term dep_anal facts t] returns a simplified form of
   the term [t] using the dependency analysis [dep_anal] and the
   true facts [facts]. *)
val simplify_term : dep_anal -> simp_facts -> term -> term

(* [check_equal t t' simp_facts] returns true when [t] and [t'] are
   proved equal when the facts in [simp_facts] are true.
   It is called from transf_insert_replace.ml. The probability of collisions
   eliminated to reach that result is taken into account by module [Proba]. *)
val check_equal : term -> term -> simp_facts -> bool

(* [display_facts_at p occ] displays the facts that are known
   to hold at the program point [occ] of the process [p]. *)
