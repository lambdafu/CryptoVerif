Analysis of the ARINC823 protocols.

This directory contains all models used to verify the ARINC823
protocols in CryptoVerif.

- arinc823prim.cvl contains the declarations of primitives
used by CryptoVerif, in addition to its standard library of primitives.
- gen is a script that analyzes all files.
- results is a summary of the results provided by this analysis.

1. Directory "sharedkey": the shared-key protocol

lemmaEnc.ocv: file for the proof of Appendix C
lemmaMAC_KDF_are_indep_PRFs_from_compression_PRF.ocv:
        file for the first proof of Appendix D
lemmaMAC_KDF_are_indep_PRFs_from_compression_ROM.ocv:
        file for the second proof of Appendix D
lemmaMAC_SUFCMA_KDF_PRF.ocv: file for the proof of Appendix E
lemmaMAC_collision_resistant.ocv: file for the proof of Appendix F

arinc823-secret-key.$p.m4.cv are the master files from which all models 
are generated using the m4 preprocessor. The generated files are
arinc823-secret-key.$p.$r.cv where
        $p is the property
	   - AUTHENTICATION for authentication properties
	   - KEY_SECRECY for secrecy of keys 
	   - SECRECY for secrecy of messages 
	   - UKS for no unknown key share attacks
	$r determines the considered replay protection
	   - ORIGINAL: no replay protection, original protocol
	   - SINGLE_TU: U never starts two sessions with the same V and 
	   timestamp tU
	   - REPLAY_PROT: Our full replay protection

2. Directory "publickey": the public-key protocol

lemmaEnc.ocv: file for the proof of Appendix C

arinc823-public-key.$p.m4.cv are the master files from which all other 
models of the original protocol are generated using the m4 preprocessor. 
The generated files are arinc823-public-key.$p.$r.cv where
        $p is the property
	   - SECRECY for secrecy of messages
	   - AUTHENTICATION for authentication properties (including
	   no unknown key share attacks)
	   - KEY_SECRECY for secrecy of keys 
	$r determines the considered replay protection
	   - NOREPLAY_PROT: no replay protection, original protocol
	   - REPLAY_PROT: Our full replay protection

arinc823-public-key.fixed.AUTHENTICATION.m4.cv
arinc823-public-key.fixed.KEY_SECRECY.m4.cv
arinc823-public-key.fixed.SECRECY.m4.cv
are the master files from which all models of our strengthened
protocol are generated using the m4 preprocessor.  The generated files
are
        arinc823-public-key.SECRECY.REPLAY_PROT.cv 
	  for forward secrecy of messages
        arinc823-public-key.KEY_SECRECY.REPLAY_PROT.cv 
          for key secrecy
        arinc823-public-key.fixed.AUTHENTICATION.REPLAY_PROT.$c.cv
	  for authentication, where $c determines the compromise scenario 
	   - NO_COMPROMISE: no compromise
	   - COMPROMISE_U for key compromise impersonation in which U is
	   compromised.
	   - COMPROMISE_V for key compromise impersonation in which V is
	   compromised.
