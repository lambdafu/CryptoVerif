CryptoVerif can also generate an F$^\star$ implementation of the protocol
from the CryptoVerif specification, using the command-line
option \texttt{-impl FStar}.
It works along similar principles to the OCaml generation of implementations,
but additionally generates F$^\star$ lemmas for equations used as
assumptions in CryptoVerif, to be proved in F$^\star$.
In the future, we plan to generate F$^\star$ axioms for security properties
proved by CryptoVerif.

The subdirectory \texttt{cv2fstar} contains files for CryptoVerif to F$^\star$
as well as an example, the Needham-Schroeder-Lowe public-key protocol.

More documentation is going to be added here in the future.
